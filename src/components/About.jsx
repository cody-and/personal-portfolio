      <p>
        Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Cody Anderson, a Twin Cities-based Web Developer and Business Student with a keen interest in driving innovation and building businesses. My educational journey after high school commenced at Northwood Technical College (formerly known as WITC) when I enrolled in the Business Management program.

        During my tenure at Northwood Tech, I discovered a deep-seated passion for working with computers and web development. This newfound enthusiasm prompted me to take a significant step forward in my academic journey by enrolling in the Full-Time Full Stack Coding Bootcamp offered by the University of Minnesota.

        In the coding bootcamp, I immersed myself in the world of web development, diving into front-end and back-end technologies, databases, and application development. This experience solidified my commitment to pursuing a career in web development, blending my business acumen with the technical skills required to innovate and contribute to the digital landscape.
